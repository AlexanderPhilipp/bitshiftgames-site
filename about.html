        <h2>Our Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal at Bitshift Games is to create fun and entertaining
          mobile games which every player can enjoy, no matter if they
          just want to play for a minute on the bus or if they want to play
          for longer
          sessions at home. One of our core philosophies is that games should be
          free-to-play
          and <strong>without</strong> being cluttered with advertisements.
          However lets face it. Mobile games that are free-to-play and have no
          advertisements are really hard to maintain profitable which is the
          reason
          why so many companies are flooding their mobile games with
          advertisements.
          Because of that all of our games are going to be free-to-play. Not
          only that
          but we are also reducing the advertisements drastically. We are only
          using Ad-Banners
          which only take up a small portion of the screen and rewarded
          advertisements which the
          player can choose to watch to receive an reward like an extra life.

        <h2>Difficulties</h2>
        <p>
          Making games for any device is hard. Making games for handheld
          devices with limited resources, limited capabilities and limited
          input sources is even harder. We have to create our games carefully
          with
          those limitations in mind. But even if we consider every limitation,
          we sometimes have to scrub ideas in the early prototyping stages just
          because
          they are not fun or not playable on mobile devices. However we are giving our best to
          deliver the best
          mobile gaming experience to you no matter where you are and on what
          device you are playing on.
          Not only that but you can make a difference. We are trying to listen
          as good as we can to our community feedback to improve our games.
          We believe that our players know the best on how to improve our games. 
          This is the reason why every review in the app store helps us. 
          No matter if they are positive or negative.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          To be honest we do not know what our games will look like in 5 years.
          However what we know is that we want to improve our games constantly 
          and slowly expand our collection of games while complying to our core 
          values and rules. Although we can not see into the future we believe that
          we are going to create awesome games with our mindset and your help/feedback.
          Like mentioned before, listening to your community is the most important factor when 
          you want to create sustainable and fun games. One thing is clear and that is that we 
          are always going to listen to our community.
